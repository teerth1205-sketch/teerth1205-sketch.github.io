This was one of the toughest and exciting projects to have worked on I used my knowledge from the curriculum to build out an Airbnb clone. I learned a lot from the process and would like to talk through some of the tougher parts in this blog post!

I built a container component which got the global state and included components for a listinglist and listinginput. These two components handled rendering the listings and the input form for a listing. One of the tougher parts was setting up the react router, figuring out these exact steps involved googling and looking back at the curriculum. The next step was rendering a listing, and since it is going to have global state because of the router part, it is also a container.  

One key aspect that helped me throughout this project was learning more about debugging and without this skill the project would not be completed. Also learning how the spread operator works to change state in the correct format in the reducer was key.
