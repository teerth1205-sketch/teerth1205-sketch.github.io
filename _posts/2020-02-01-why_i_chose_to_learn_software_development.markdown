On my previous path I decided to study Physics, which is and always will be very interesting to me. I learned a lot of complex math and science while in my program, the one thing I remeber being the toughest and most fullfilling part of my education was the research project i worked on. This was where I got my first exposure to software development, I was writing a program to analyze data from a database containing information about galaxies! My undergrad had finished soon after this project so i didnt have time to change majors or take in a comp sci minor. I was kinda disssapointed. After this point i started working as a tutor in math, i enjoyed this job but knew that there was more out there to do. 

Soon after, my cousin went to a coding bootcamp and had succeeded, in only a few months and had also found a job. I knew it was now all possible to find my dream job as a developer. I saw where he was working and wanted that kind of open office enviroment, so i myself decided to go to bootcamp.
